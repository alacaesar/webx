European history and 20th century art is a big inspiration, and I love to reimagine historical clothing and modernist art as contemporary fashion. Sustainability is at the heart of all my practices and I use a lot of deadstock and upcycled fabrics in my work. I am fascinated by the relationship that fashion has with emerging technology and have previously used methods such as 3D Printing to create work, but am particularly excited about the rise of virtual fashion and the impact that it is going to have on the industry.",
